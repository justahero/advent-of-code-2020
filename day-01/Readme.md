# Day 01

[Advent Of Code Day 01](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/1)

There is a input text file with a list of numbers, see [input.txt](./input.txt). Each line in this file contains a single number.

The basic idea is as follows.

* open text file
* read all numbers into a vec(?)
* find two numbers that add up to 2020
* read / check [Vec documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html)
* multiply both numbers and print it
