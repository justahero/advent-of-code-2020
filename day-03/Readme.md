## Part 1

Requirements

* the map consists of width / height entries
* the width is repeated / cycled over and over
* movement down requires to adjust the map horizontally, integrate cycling
* it's over once the toboggan travelled the full height of the map
* it seems a horizontal pointer needs to be kept and put into the next row
* it seems it is worth to keep the width of the map
