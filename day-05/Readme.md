## Part 1

Binary Boarding

A boarding passs has the following structure: `BFBFFFFLRR`, where the first 8 letters (`BFBFFFF`) define the row, while the last 3 letters (`LRR`) define the seat in this row.

The first part of the boarding pass are instructions to find the row (0..127) via binary space partitioning.
